      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li>Sep 9th, - Born on September 9th, 1941 in Bronxville NY</li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1967 - Ritchie started working at Bell Labs in 1967. Here is
          where he worked on Multics operating system.
        </li>
        <li>
          May 1st, 1968 - Ritchie earned his bachelor's degree in Physics in
          1963, and completed his Doctorate degree in Mathematics in 1968 from
          Harvard University.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1969 - Bell Labs dropped the Multics operating systems
          project in 1969. This prompted Ritchie to develop C programming
          language and, with Thompson, create the UNIX operating system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nov 3rd, 1971 - Unix was released on November 3rd, 1971, opening a
          operating system to work on a variety of platforms with highly adapted
          quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1972 - Ritchie and Thompson's operating system was not
          functioning on the more advanced PDP-11 mini computer in 1971. This
          prompted Ritchie to create C programming lanuage. C programming
          lanuage is very popular and important to the development of software
          including programs such as C++ and Java.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1973 - Ritchie and Thompson wrote UNIX using C programming
          language. This allowed for UNIX to work a wide variety of computers in
          a range of large and minicomputers and advanced to simple computers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1983 - Cowinner (with Ken Thompson) of the A.M. Turing Award.
          It is a prestigious award and the top achievement in Computer Science.
          They recieved this award for, "their development of generic operating
          systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX
          operating system" (Hosch).
        </li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1988 - Ritchie was elected into the U.S National Academy of
          Engineering in 1988.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1990 - Ritchie was appointed the head of the System Software
          Research Department at Bell Labs in 1990.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1994 - Awarded the 1994 Computer Pioneer Award, "In
          recognition of contribution to the development of Unix" (Dennis).
        </li>
        <li>
          Jan 1st, 1995 - In 1995 Ritchie (and his team) released Plan 9
          operating system. Plan 9 attempted to integrate graphics and
          networking into a Unix platform. "They kept the Unix choice to mediate
          access to as many system services as possible through a single big
          file-hierarchy name space" (Plan 9).
        </li>
        <li>
          Apr 1st, 1996 - Ritchie (with team members) released the inferno
          Operating System in April 1996. Inferno is a operating system for
          building distributed and networked systems on a large range of
          platforms and systems. "You can fectch it now as Free Software, on
          similar terms to Linux orxBSD" (Inferno).
        </li>
        <li>
          Apr 21st, 1999 - Richie and Thompson are awarded the U.S. National
          Medal of Technology Award from President Bill Clinton for inventing
          UNIX and C programming language.
        </li>
        <li>
          Oct 12th, 2011 - Died October 12th, 2011 in Berkeley Heights, NJ
